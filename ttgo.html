<p>Go undercover with the Teen Titans. Use Cyborg's Doomsday Machine to smash buildings and crush the competition in an all-villain game show. Customize your mech with weapons based on Robin, Raven, Cyborg, Starfire, and Beast Boy. Battle it out until you're the Last Villain Standing!</p>

<p>This game asked for lots of exploratory testing. With 3 different giant robots and several robot parts with different attacks and attributes to balance, there were too many robot parts combinations to test. The first idea was to procedurally generate all levels, but the team decided to create each level manually, so the testing effort to play and replay each level, providing meaningful feedback was huge. Also, the player could do a set of 3 missions per stage and fight several bosses, so I had to take extra care regarding exploits. </p>
