<p>This sequel of Cartoon Network Superstar Soccer has a more complex set of gameplay features. With an improved passing/shotting/dribbling/tackling system and unique captain's abilities, my role as game tester was even more necessary since early stages of development. There were lots of possible scenarios while testing how players could interact with each other and several multiplayer matches were available, such as Online, Same Wifi Network and Play with a Friend. During this project I had to work close with devs and the lead game designer to make sure everything worked as expected, while the game was still fun.</p>
