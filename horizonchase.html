<p>Horizon Chase is a modern take on the 90s old-school racers that we loved the most such as Out Run or Top Gear. The game features unique art direction, with a bright and colorful palette that mixes low-poly environments and highly detailed 2D backgrounds. Controls are very straightforward and comfortable, providing an exciting arcade experience. What really sets Horizon Chase apart from other racing games is the blend of its arcade style and the strong sense of actual exploration and discovery that the player feels through its many and quite diverse circuits. </p>

<p>With Horizon Chase, I had the opportunity to mentor a game tester intern, teaching him the importance of a well written bug report, how to reproduce issues and think outside the box to find those nasty bugs that can ruin the player's experience. Since Horizon Chase was the first self published game by Aquiris, and heavily inspired by nostalgic racing games, I had a different approach while testing it, paying attention to details that could improve player's experience and providing more gameplay feedback to designers than previous projects. Since the game pays homage to old games and movies, I felt that our brazilian audience deserved a great localization, so I offered to take care of this task, reviewing and researching with the team which expressions would be cool and funny for our audience. It seemed something small at the time, but when we saw reviews praising brazilian portuguese localization, our extra effort paid off.</p>
