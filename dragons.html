<p>Think you’ve got what it takes to be a rider of Berk? Put your skills to the test! Blaze your own path as a dragon trainer. Explore the island, train wild dragons, and take flight in awesome aerial challenges! Ride the dragons you love from the movies: Gronckle, Deadly Nadder, Monstrous Nightmare, Hideous Zippleback, and Night Fury! Plus, watch for new dragon species from the series. Every time a new dragon appears in the show, you’ll be able to train it in the game!</p>

<p>This was the first game that I tested as a professional. My mindset was still too analitical, since my professional background was heavily based on software testing and I was still in college, about to graduate in Computer Science. The team was tracking bugs on a Google Docs document and focused too much on the happy path, so I could found lots of bugs they never imagine that existed. Since I joined the team few weeks before launch, I focused on breaking the game by diving into ocean, flying above sky until my character surpassed the defined world boundaries and performed lots of exploratory testing. This game represented one long partnership between Aquiris and Cartoon Network, so I'm proud of the work I could do in such little time.</p>
