<p>Ballistic was a big step on my career. Our main concerns were to deliver beautiful graphics and a smooth experience on a Facebook multiplayer game, so I had to plan lots of playtests, focusing on technical issues like lag, connection errors and exploits. As the game evolved and new versions were launched, our team members changed and new systems were designed, so I had to adapt with new tools and methodologies as I learned how games are made.
I spent 4 years working on different versions of Ballistic, delivering the Steam version, knows as Ballistic Overkill in a Early Access stage. This project allowed me to try different approaches on my job, creating solutions to improve our developing cycle from the game designer, to the programmer or localization professional perspective.</p>
